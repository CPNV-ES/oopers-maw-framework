# Framework MVC (MAW)
A simple MVC framework that is used for this app [Exercice Looper](https://github.com/CPNV-ES/oopers-maw-exercise-looper) and evolves with it's needs.
## Why ?
The realization of this framework is an exercise carried out (MAW) as part of our training at CPNV. The aim is to create a simple-to-use, object-oriented MVC framework.
## The developpment
- The app is made in PHP and follow the PSR-12 standard.
- IDE is PHPStorm
- The principle followed is KISS (Keep it simple stupid)
- We use the 'GitFlow' branching strategy
- We use a scrum-based approach inside [Jira Software](https://ejcpnvprojects.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/MAW1/boards/2/backlog)
